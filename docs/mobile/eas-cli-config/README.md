# EAS CLI Configuration Documentation

This folder contains all EAS CLI configuration notes, changes, and troubleshooting steps.

## Purpose

- See what was working before
- Revert to previous working configurations
- Understand why changes were made
- Avoid repeating the same mistakes

## File Naming Convention
- `YYYY-MM-DD-description.md` - Date-based entries
- `issue-typeScript-config-error.md` - Issue-specific documentation
- `working-config-YYYY-MM-DD.md` - Known working configurations

## Current Status
