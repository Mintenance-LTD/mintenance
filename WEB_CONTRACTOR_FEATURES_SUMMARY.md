## üìä **DATA ARCHITECTURE**

All pages use **REAL database data** from Supabase:

### **Key Tables Used:**
1. **`users`** - Contractor profiles, stats, availability
2. **`contractor_skills`** - Skills/expertise tags
3. **`reviews`** - Ratings and review comments
4. **`jobs`** - Job history, photos, status
5. **`contractor_posts`** - Portfolio showcases
6. **`escrow_transactions`** - Payment and revenue tracking
7. **`bids`** - Bidding activity

### **No Mock Data:**
- ‚ùå NO hardcoded contractor names
- ‚ùå NO fake Unsplash images
- ‚ùå NO mock statistics
- ‚úÖ ALL data fetched from Supabase
- ‚úÖ REAL user profiles, jobs, reviews
- ‚úÖ REAL financial metrics

---

## üé® **DESIGN PRINCIPLES**

### **Consistent Styling:**
- Uses `@/lib/theme` for colors, spacing, typography
- Consistent card layouts with borders and shadows
- Hover effects for interactivity
- Responsive grid layouts

### **Component Architecture:**
- Server Components for data fetching (pages)
- Client Components for interactivity (filters, charts)
- Modular, reusable components
- Clean separation of concerns

### **UX Features:**
- Loading states (handled by Next.js)
- Empty states with helpful messaging
- Authentication guards (contractor-only pages)
- Clear navigation between sections

---

## üêõ **KNOWN ISSUES**

1. **Client Component Import Issue** (Currently Being Fixed)
   - Error: `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'call')`
   - Occurs on `/contractors` page
   - Related to lazy-loading of client components
   - **Impact:** Contractors directory currently showing error boundary
   - **Fix:** Need to adjust component imports or mark as 'use client'

2. **Next.js 15 Async API Requirements**
   - Fixed: `searchParams` now properly awaited
   - Fixed: `headers()` properly awaited in other pages
   - All pages now compatible with Next.js 15

---

## ‚úÖ **TESTING PERFORMED**

### **Pages Tested:**
1. ‚úÖ `/contractor/profile` - Auth guard working correctly
2. ‚ö†Ô∏è `/contractors` - Has rendering error (being fixed)
3. ‚è≥ `/analytics` - Not yet tested (requires contractor login)

### **Data Verification:**
- ‚úÖ Database connection working
- ‚úÖ Query results returning (0 contractors in current DB)
- ‚úÖ Skills list populated (6 skills in DB)
- ‚úÖ Filters functional (dropdowns populated)

## üöÄ **NEXT STEPS**

1. **Fix client component import issue** on `/contractors` page
2. **Test Analytics page** with logged-in contractor
3. **Test Profile page** with logged-in contractor
4. **Add test data** to database (create sample contractors)
5. **Verify all features** with real data
