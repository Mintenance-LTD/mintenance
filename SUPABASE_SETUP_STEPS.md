## ðŸ“‹ **Step-by-Step Instructions**

Copy the entire contents of `create-test-user.sql` and paste it into the Supabase SQL Editor you have open.

Click the "Run" button in the SQL Editor

### **3. Verify Success**
You should see messages like:
- `Test users created successfully!`
- `Profiles created successfully!`

After running the script, you'll have these test accounts:

**Homeowner Account:**
- Email: `test@homeowner.com`
- Password: `password123`

**Contractor Account:**
- Email: `test@contractor.com`
