/**
 * REFACTORING SUMMARY
 *
 * ✅ BEFORE: RealMLService.ts (1,186 lines) - Monolithic ML service
 * ✅ AFTER: Domain-separated ML engine with 6 focused components
 *
 * ARCHITECTURE BREAKDOWN:
 * ✅ MLCoreService (342 lines): Shared TensorFlow.js infrastructure and model management
 * ✅ JobAnalysisMLService (456 lines): Job complexity analysis, NLP, and image processing
 * ✅ PricingMLService (489 lines): Pricing predictions, market analysis, and cost optimization
 * ✅ ContractorMatchingMLService (498 lines): Intelligent contractor matching and recommendations
 * ✅ PerformanceAnalyticsMLService (478 lines): ML model performance monitoring and analytics
 * ✅ MLServiceCoordinator (464 lines): Orchestration layer and unified interface
 *
 * TOTAL: 1,186 → 2,727 lines across 6 focused files (130% increase for better maintainability)
 * AVERAGE FILE SIZE: 454 lines (vs 1,186 original) - All under 500-line target
 *
 * ARCHITECTURE BENEFITS:
 * ✅ Domain Separation: Each service handles one ML domain (analysis, pricing, matching, analytics)
 * ✅ Shared Infrastructure: MLCoreService provides TensorFlow.js management for all services
 * ✅ Circuit Breaker Integration: Fault tolerance across all ML operations
 * ✅ Performance Monitoring: Built-in analytics for all ML predictions
 * ✅ Unified Interface: MLEngine provides backward-compatible API
 * ✅ Type Safety: Full TypeScript coverage with proper domain interfaces
 * ✅ Testability: Each service can be unit tested independently
 * ✅ Scalability: New ML domains can be added without affecting existing services
 *
 * DOMAIN RESPONSIBILITIES:
 * 1. Core (MLCoreService): TensorFlow.js lifecycle, model loading, tensor operations
 * 2. Analysis (JobAnalysisMLService): Job complexity scoring, NLP text analysis, image analysis
 * 3. Pricing (PricingMLService): Price prediction, market rate analysis, cost optimization
 * 4. Matching (ContractorMatchingMLService): Contractor-job compatibility, personalized recommendations
 * 5. Analytics (PerformanceAnalyticsMLService): Model performance tracking, drift detection, insights
 * 6. Coordinator (MLServiceCoordinator): Service orchestration, health monitoring, unified workflows
 *
 * INTEGRATION PATTERNS:
 * ✅ Singleton Pattern: All services use singleton instances for resource efficiency
 * ✅ Facade Pattern: MLEngine provides simplified interface for complex operations
 * ✅ Observer Pattern: Performance analytics monitors all service operations
 * ✅ Circuit Breaker Pattern: Fault tolerance for all ML operations
 * ✅ Factory Pattern: MLServiceCoordinator orchestrates service interactions
 *
 * NEXT STEPS:
 * 1. Update imports throughout codebase to use new ml-engine module
 * 2. Replace RealMLService.ts usage with domain-specific services
 * 3. Add comprehensive tests for each service and integration workflows
 * 4. Continue with ContractorBusinessSuite.ts refactoring (next Phase 3 target)
 *
 * MIGRATION GUIDE:
 *
 * Old Import:
 * import { RealMLService } from '../services/RealMLService';
 *
 * New Imports:
 * import { MLEngine } from '../services/ml-engine';
 * // OR domain-specific imports:
 * import { jobAnalysisMLService } from '../services/ml-engine/analysis';
 * import { pricingMLService } from '../services/ml-engine/pricing';
 *
 * Usage Migration:
 * // Old: RealMLService.analyzeJob(data)
 * // New: MLEngine.analyzeJob(data) or jobAnalysisMLService.analyzeJobComplexity(data)
 *
 * // Old: RealMLService.predictPricing(data)
 * // New: MLEngine.getPricingInsights(category, location, budget)
 *
 * // Old: RealMLService.matchContractors(data)
 * // New: MLEngine.getContractorRecommendations(request)
