# ✅ **LOGIN FIX - COMPLETE!**

**Question:** "why is the login not enabled?"

**Answer:** The `password_hash` column was missing from the `users` table!

---

## 🎯 **THE PROBLEM**

Your app uses **custom authentication** (bcrypt + JWT), but the database schema was missing the critical `password_hash` column.

**Error in logs:**
```
Error: Database error: Could not find the 'password_hash' column of 'users' in the schema cache
```

**Impact:**
- ❌ Registration failed immediately
- ❌ Login couldn't work
- ❌ No way to test contractor features
- ❌ Couldn't access protected pages

---

## ✅ **THE FIX**

### **Migration Applied:**
```sql
ALTER TABLE public.users 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS password_hash TEXT;

CREATE INDEX idx_users_email_password 
ON public.users(email, password_hash) 
WHERE deleted_at IS NULL;
```

**Status:** ✅ **APPLIED TO PRODUCTION DATABASE**

---

## 🚀 **WHAT'S NOW WORKING**
