# ‚úÖ **DISCOVER PAGE FIX - COMPLETE!**

**Date:** October 11, 2025  
**Issue Fixed:** Discover page now role-aware  
**Status:** üü¢ **READY FOR TESTING**

---

## üéØ **ISSUE**

User reported:
> "Discover page currently shows contractors (for homeowners). Should have contractor version showing JOBS to swipe on."

---

## ‚úÖ **FIX APPLIED**

The Discover page now intelligently shows different content based on user role:

| User Type | What They See | What They Can Do |
|-----------|---------------|------------------|
| **Contractor** | Jobs to bid on | Swipe right to express interest |
| **Homeowner** | Contractors to hire | Swipe right to like contractors |

---

## üîß **IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS**

### **File Modified:**
- `apps/web/app/discover/page.tsx`

### **Changes:**
1. Added `jobs[]` state for contractors
2. Added `loadJobs()` function to fetch jobs from API
3. Role-based data loading in useEffect
4. Updated swipe handler for both roles
5. Created `JobCard` component (new!)
6. Conditional UI rendering based on `user.role`

### **New Component: JobCard**
Beautiful card showing:
- Category badge
- Posted date
- Job title & description
- Budget (prominent display)
- Location
- Timeline
- Homeowner info

---

## üì± **HOW IT WORKS**

### **For Contractors:**
```typescript
if (user.role === 'contractor') {
  loadJobs(); // Fetch available jobs
  // Show job cards
  // Swipe right = express interest/bid
}
```

### **For Homeowners:**
```typescript
else {
  loadContractors(); // Fetch nearby contractors
  // Show contractor cards
  // Swipe right = like contractor
}
```
