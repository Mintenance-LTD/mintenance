# üöÄ Quick Setup Guide - Mintenance Web App

This guide will help you set up and run the Mintenance web application for testing.

---

## ‚ö° Quick Start (5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Generate JWT Secret

Run this command to generate a secure JWT secret:

```bash
node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"
```

Copy the output (64-character string).

### Step 2: Create Environment File

Create a file at `apps/web/.env.local` with the following content:

```env
# JWT Secret (paste the value from Step 1)
JWT_SECRET=<paste-your-generated-secret-here>

# Supabase Configuration
# Get these from: https://app.supabase.com/project/_/settings/api
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key-here
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key-here

# App Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
NODE_ENV=development

# Stripe Configuration (Optional - for payment features)
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_your-test-key
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_your-webhook-secret
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_your-publishable-key
```

### Step 3: Install Dependencies (if not done)

```bash
npm install
```

### Step 4: Start the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

### Step 5: Run Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm run e2e

# Or run specific test suites
npx playwright test homepage.spec.js
npx playwright test auth.spec.js
npx playwright test features.spec.js
```

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Setup

### Option 1: Use Existing Database

If you have an existing Supabase project with the schema, you're all set!

### Option 2: Set Up New Database

1. In your Supabase project, go to **SQL Editor**
2. Run the migration files in this order:
   ```
   - supabase-setup.sql
   - database-rls-setup.sql
   - enhanced-jobs-migration.sql
   - (other migration files as needed)
   ```

### Option 3: Testing Without Real Database

For quick testing without database connectivity:
- Authentication will fail (expected)
- Static pages will work (homepage, about, terms, privacy)
- Protected pages will redirect to login

---

## üí≥ Stripe Setup (Optional)

### For Full Payment Testing:

1. Go to https://stripe.com
2. Create account or sign in
3. Enable **Test Mode** (toggle in dashboard)
4. Navigate to **Developers** ‚Üí **API Keys**
5. Copy:
   - **Publishable key** ‚Üí `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`
   - **Secret key** ‚Üí `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`
6. Navigate to **Developers** ‚Üí **Webhooks**
7. Add endpoint: `http://localhost:3000/api/webhooks/stripe`

### For Testing Without Stripe:

Payment features will show errors, but other features will work.

## üß™ Test Execution

### Running Tests with Browser UI

```bash
npm run e2e:ui
```

This opens Playwright's UI where you can:
- See all available tests
- Run tests individually
- Watch tests execute in real-time
- Debug failed tests

### Running Specific Browsers

```bash
# Chromium only
npx playwright test --project=chromium

# Firefox only
npx playwright test --project=firefox

# Mobile Chrome
npx playwright test --project="Mobile Chrome"

# All browsers
npx playwright test
```

### Debugging Failed Tests

```bash
# Run with headed browser (see what's happening)
npx playwright test --headed

# Run with debug mode
npx playwright test --debug

# Run specific test
npx playwright test homepage.spec.js:5
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Problem: "Cannot GET /"

**Solution**: The dev server hasn't started properly.
```bash
# Kill existing node processes
taskkill /F /IM node.exe

# Restart dev server
cd apps/web
npm run dev
```

### Problem: "JWT_SECRET is required"

**Solution**: You haven't created `.env.local` file.
- Follow Step 2 above
- Make sure the file is in `apps/web/.env.local`

### Problem: Database connection errors

**Solution**: Check your Supabase credentials.
```bash
# Test connection
curl https://your-project.supabase.co/rest/v1/
```

### Problem: Tests timeout

**Solution**: Increase timeout in `playwright.config.js`:
```js
use: {
  timeout: 60000, // Increase to 60 seconds
}
```

### Problem: Port 3000 already in use

**Solution**: 
```bash
# Find process using port 3000
netstat -ano | findstr :3000

# Kill the process (replace PID)
taskkill /PID <process-id> /F

# Or use a different port
cd apps/web
npx next dev -p 3001
```
