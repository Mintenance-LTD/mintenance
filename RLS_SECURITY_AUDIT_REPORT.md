## Detailed Findings

### üü¢ EXCELLENT (No Issues)

#### 1. Security Tables - Properly Locked Down
```sql
-- webhook_events: Service role only ‚úÖ
CREATE POLICY webhook_events_service_role_only
ON public.webhook_events FOR ALL TO service_role
USING (true) WITH CHECK (true);

-- security_events: Admin read, service_role insert ‚úÖ
CREATE POLICY security_events_select_policy
ON public.security_events FOR SELECT TO authenticated
USING (public.is_admin());

CREATE POLICY security_events_insert_policy
ON public.security_events FOR INSERT TO service_role
WITH CHECK (true);
```

**‚úÖ SECURE**: System tables cannot be accessed by regular users

#### 2. Refresh Tokens - User Isolation
```sql
CREATE POLICY refresh_tokens_select_policy
ON public.refresh_tokens FOR SELECT TO authenticated
USING (auth.uid() = user_id OR public.is_admin());
```

**‚úÖ SECURE**: Users can only see their own refresh tokens

#### 3. Admin Override Functions
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.is_admin()
RETURNS BOOLEAN LANGUAGE sql SECURITY DEFINER
AS $$
  SELECT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM public.users u
    WHERE u.id = auth.uid() AND u.role = 'admin'
  );
$$;
```

**‚úÖ SECURE**: Properly uses SECURITY DEFINER with explicit user table check

---

### üü° MINOR IMPROVEMENTS RECOMMENDED

#### Issue #1: Messages - Overly Permissive
**Current Policy:**
```sql
CREATE POLICY messages_select_policy
ON public.messages FOR SELECT TO authenticated
USING (
  public.is_admin()
  OR auth.uid() = sender_id
  OR auth.uid() = receiver_id
  OR public.is_job_participant(job_id)  -- ‚ö†Ô∏è TOO BROAD
);
```

**Risk:** `is_job_participant()` allows ANY contractor who bid on a job to read ALL messages
**Severity:** LOW (messages are job-related, but still leaky)
**Recommendation:**
```sql
-- Tighten to only active job participants (assigned contractor)
USING (
  public.is_admin()
  OR auth.uid() = sender_id
  OR auth.uid() = receiver_id
  OR (job_id IN (
    SELECT id FROM jobs
    WHERE (homeowner_id = auth.uid() OR contractor_id = auth.uid())
      AND contractor_id IS NOT NULL  -- Only assigned jobs
  ))
);
```

#### Issue #2: Contractor Posts - Public Schema Leak
**Current Policy:**
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Anyone can view public posts" ON contractor_posts
FOR SELECT USING (is_public = true);  -- ‚ö†Ô∏è Unauthenticated access
```

**Risk:** Anonymous users can enumerate all contractor work (portfolio mining)
**Severity:** LOW (intended feature, but consider rate limiting)
**Recommendation:**
- Add rate limiting middleware for `/api/contractor-posts` endpoint
- Consider requiring authentication for bulk access
- Keep current policy for individual post views

#### Issue #3: Contractor Skills - Information Disclosure
**Current Policy:**
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Anyone can view contractor skills" ON contractor_skills
FOR SELECT USING (true);  -- ‚ö†Ô∏è Completely open
```

**Risk:** Competitor intelligence gathering (skill enumeration attacks)
**Severity:** LOW (public marketplace feature)
**Recommendation:**
- Add rate limiting on skills endpoint
- Consider obfuscating exact skill counts for non-authenticated users
- Keep policy as-is but monitor for scraping activity

---

### üü¢ WELL-DESIGNED POLICIES

#### Users Table - Perfect Balance
```sql
-- Self-access OR admin ‚úÖ
CREATE POLICY users_select_self ON public.users
FOR SELECT TO authenticated
USING (auth.uid() = id OR public.is_admin());

CREATE POLICY users_update_self ON public.users
FOR UPDATE TO authenticated
USING (auth.uid() = id OR public.is_admin())
WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = id OR public.is_admin());
```

**‚úÖ EXCELLENT**: No user can read other users' data except admins

#### Jobs Table - Multi-Party Access
```sql
CREATE POLICY jobs_select_policy ON public.jobs
FOR SELECT TO authenticated
USING (
  public.is_admin()
  OR auth.uid() = homeowner_id
  OR auth.uid() = contractor_id
  OR status = 'posted'  -- ‚úÖ Smart: Public job board
);
```

**‚úÖ EXCELLENT**: Only shows private jobs to participants, public jobs to all

#### Bids Table - Proper Isolation
```sql
-- Contractors see own bids ‚úÖ
CREATE POLICY "Contractors can view their own bids" ON bids
FOR SELECT USING (contractor_id = auth.uid());

-- Job owners see all bids on their jobs ‚úÖ
CREATE POLICY "Job owners can view bids on their jobs" ON bids
FOR SELECT USING (
  job_id IN (SELECT id FROM jobs WHERE homeowner_id = auth.uid())
);
```

**‚úÖ EXCELLENT**: No bid snooping between contractors

## Testing Recommendations

### Test Case 1: User Isolation
```sql
-- As User A (contractor)
SELECT * FROM bids WHERE contractor_id != auth.uid();
-- Expected: 0 rows (only see own bids)

-- As User B (homeowner)
SELECT * FROM bids WHERE job_id IN (SELECT id FROM jobs WHERE homeowner_id = auth.uid());
-- Expected: All bids on their jobs
```

### Test Case 2: Admin Override
```sql
-- As Admin user
SELECT * FROM users WHERE id != auth.uid();
-- Expected: All users visible

-- As Regular user
SELECT * FROM users WHERE id != auth.uid();
-- Expected: 0 rows
```

### Test Case 3: Message Privacy
```sql
-- As User A (not job participant)
SELECT * FROM messages WHERE job_id = '<some-job-id>';
-- Expected: 0 rows

-- As Job Contractor
SELECT * FROM messages WHERE job_id = '<assigned-job-id>';
-- Expected: All messages for that job
```

## Priority Fixes

### P3 (Optional - Not Blocking Production)
1. **Tighten Messages Policy** (2 hours)
   - Modify `messages_select_policy` to exclude contractors without assigned jobs

2. **Add Rate Limiting** (4 hours)
   - Implement endpoint rate limiting for public contractor data
   - Add monitoring for scraping activity
   - Document rate limits in API docs

**Key Strengths:**
1. 100% RLS coverage on all tables
2. Secure admin override pattern
3. Proper service_role isolation for system tables
4. Well-designed multi-party access policies

**No critical security issues found.**
