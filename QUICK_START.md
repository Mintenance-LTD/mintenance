## ⚡ 3-Step Setup

### Step 1: Get Your API Keys (5 minutes)

#### Supabase Service Role Key
1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/ukrjudtlvapiajkjbcrd/settings/api
2. Find "service_role" key (secret)
3. Copy it

#### Stripe Secret Key
1. Go to: https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/apikeys
2. Find "Secret key" (starts with `sk_test_`)
3. Click "Reveal test key" and copy it

---

### Step 2: Add Keys to `.env` (2 minutes)

Open `.env` file and add:

```bash
# Add these two lines:
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=eyJhbGc...your-key-here
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...your-key-here
```

---

### Step 3: Test Everything (8 minutes)

```bash
# 1. Apply database migration (2 min)
npx supabase db push

# 2. Run comprehensive test suite (6 min)
npm run test:payment
```

**Expected Output:**
```
✅ All Tests Passed!
Your payment infrastructure is working correctly.
You can now deploy the payment API endpoints to production.
```

## 🔐 Security Action Required

**Revoke exposed OpenAI API key:**

1. Go to: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
2. Find key: `sk-proj-tqwYLfLeF5uwcw6eQb51...`
3. Click "Revoke"
4. Generate new key for server use (if needed)

⚠️ **This is critical** - the old key was exposed in version control.

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "Missing SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY"
→ Add the service role key to `.env` (see Step 1)

### "Missing STRIPE_SECRET_KEY"
→ Add the Stripe secret key to `.env` (see Step 1)

### Tests fail
→ Check `.env` has correct keys
→ Check database migration ran successfully
→ See [scripts/README.md](./scripts/README.md) for more help
