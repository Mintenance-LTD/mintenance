# PROJECT INSTRUCTIONS - MINTENANCE CODEBASE

## MANDATORY SUB-AGENT USAGE RULES

### CRITICAL: Sub-Agent Invocation Requirements

#### 1. Codebase Context Analyzer (MANDATORY - MUST BE CALLED FIRST)
**YOU MUST** invoke the `codebase-context-analyzer` agent BEFORE:
- Fixing any bug (no matter how small)
- Modifying any feature
- Adding new functionality
- Refactoring existing code
- Making performance optimizations
- Addressing security issues
- Making any database changes
- Modifying API endpoints
- Changing component behavior
- Updating styles or UI elements
- Modifying configuration files
- Changing business logic

**How to invoke:**
```
Use Task tool with subagent_type: "general-purpose"
Prompt: "Act as the codebase-context-analyzer agent defined in .claude/agents/codebase-context-analyzer.md. Analyze [specific area/bug/feature] in the mintenance codebase and provide a comprehensive context analysis following the exact structured format specified in the agent definition. Include all sections: Scope Summary, Current Implementation, Dependencies Map, Similar Patterns, Risk Analysis, Recommended Approach, and Additional Context."
```

#### 2. Specialized Agent Usage Rules

**ALWAYS** use the appropriate specialized agent for domain-specific work:

- **UI/UX work** → `ui-designer` agent (AFTER context analyzer)
- **Testing** → `testing-specialist` agent (AFTER implementation)
- **Security** → `security-expert` agent (WITH context analyzer for security issues)
- **Performance** → `performance-optimizer` agent (AFTER context analyzer)
- **Mobile** → `mobile-developer` agent (AFTER context analyzer for mobile changes)
- **Frontend** → `frontend-specialist` agent (AFTER context analyzer for React/TypeScript)
- **DevOps** → `devops-engineer` agent (FOR deployment/CI/CD issues)
- **Database** → `database-architect` agent (AFTER context analyzer for DB changes)
- **API Design** → `api-architect` agent (AFTER context analyzer for API work)
- **Property Assessment** → `ai-building-engineer` or `building-surveyor-ai` agent

#### 3. Multi-Agent Workflow (MANDATORY SEQUENCE)

For ANY code modification, follow this exact sequence:

1. **FIRST (ALWAYS)**: `codebase-context-analyzer` - Get full context and impact analysis
2. **SECOND**: Relevant specialized agent(s) - Implementation based on context
3. **THIRD**: `testing-specialist` - Verify changes don't break anything
4. **FINAL**: `codebase-context-analyzer` - Final review before marking complete

**Example for bug fix:**
```
1. Context Analyzer → "Analyze authentication bug in login flow"
2. Frontend Specialist → "Fix the bug following context analyzer recommendations"
3. Testing Specialist → "Write/update tests for the fix"
4. Context Analyzer → "Final review of authentication bug fix"
```

#### 4. Parallel Agent Execution

When multiple independent analyses are needed, run agents in parallel:
```
Single message with multiple Task tool invocations:
- Task 1: Context analysis for area A
- Task 2: Security review for area B
- Task 3: Performance check for area C
```

#### 5. Agent Review Requirements

**BEFORE marking any task complete or committing code:**
1. Run `codebase-context-analyzer` for final review
2. Ensure ALL recommendations from agents were followed
3. Document any deviations with justification
4. Verify no new issues were introduced
5. Confirm all existing tests still pass
6. Check that new tests were added if needed

#### 6. No Exceptions Policy

**NEVER skip agent invocation**, even for:
- "Simple" one-line fixes (often have hidden dependencies)
- "Urgent" hotfixes (proper analysis prevents cascading failures)
- "Obvious" changes (context reveals non-obvious impacts)
- "Documentation only" changes (may affect API contracts)
- "Style only" changes (may break component rendering)
- "Config only" changes (may affect multiple environments)

#### 7. Agent Output Integration

**YOU MUST**:
- Read ENTIRE agent output before proceeding
- Follow ALL recommendations unless technically impossible
- Document in code comments WHY if you deviate
- Include agent insights in commit messages
- Reference specific risks identified by agents
- Create TODOs for any deferred recommendations

#### 8. Failure Protocol

If an agent identifies HIGH RISK or recommends NOT proceeding:
1. STOP immediately
2. Present the risks to the user
3. Get explicit approval before continuing
4. Document the decision in the code

### ENFORCEMENT RULES

1. **Any code change without context analysis = INCOMPLETE TASK**
2. **Any bug fix without testing verification = POTENTIAL REGRESSION**
3. **Any feature without specialized agent review = TECHNICAL DEBT**
4. **Any deployment without final review = PRODUCTION RISK**

### COMMIT MESSAGE FORMAT

All commits MUST include agent analysis reference:
```
fix: [issue description]

Context Analysis: [key findings from context analyzer]
Implementation: [approach taken based on agent recommendations]
Testing: [verification performed]
Risk: [any remaining risks identified]

Reviewed by: codebase-context-analyzer
Specialized agents: [list of other agents used]
```

## PROJECT-SPECIFIC RULES

### Database Commands
- npx supabase db diff --local

### Code Quality Requirements
- Do what has been asked; nothing more, nothing less
- NEVER create files unless absolutely necessary
- ALWAYS prefer editing existing files over creating new ones
- NEVER proactively create documentation files (*.md) unless explicitly requested
- ALWAYS use agents to understand existing patterns before adding new code

### Mintenance-Specific Contexts
- This is a multi-tenant platform for property maintenance
- Web app (Next.js) and Mobile app (React Native) share code
- Supabase backend with PostgreSQL and Row Level Security
- Stripe integration for payments
- Real-time features via Supabase subscriptions
- Three user types: homeowners, contractors, admin

## VERIFICATION CHECKLIST

Before ANY code is written or modified:
- [ ] Context Analyzer has been run
- [ ] Dependencies have been mapped
- [ ] Similar patterns have been identified
- [ ] Risks have been assessed
- [ ] Specialized agent has reviewed (if applicable)
- [ ] Testing strategy is defined
- [ ] Impact on other components is understood

This is NOT optional. These rules ensure code quality, prevent regressions, and maintain consistency across the entire mintenance platform.
