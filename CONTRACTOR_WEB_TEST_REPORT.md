## 🚨 Critical Issues

### Issue #1: Jobs & Bids Page - 404 NOT FOUND 🔴
**Severity**: HIGH  
**URL**: `/contractor/bid`  
**Status**: Page does not exist

**Description**:
The "Jobs & Bids" link in the contractor sidebar points to `/contractor/bid`, but this page returns a 404 error.

**Impact**:
- Contractors cannot access the bidding interface
- This is a core feature for contractors to bid on jobs
- Navigation link exists but destination page is missing

**Expected Behavior**:
Should display a page where contractors can:
- View available jobs to bid on
- Submit bids/proposals
- Track bid status
- Manage active bids

**Reproduction Steps**:
1. Log in as contractor
2. Click "Jobs & Bids" in sidebar under "OPERATIONS" section
3. Page returns 404

**Recommended Fix**:
- Create `/contractor/bid/page.tsx` 
- Or redirect link to existing jobs page: `/jobs`
- Or create a proper bidding interface at `/contractor/bid`

---

### Issue #2: Messages Page - Access Denied 🔴
**Severity**: HIGH  
**URL**: `/messages`  
**Status**: Authentication/Session Detection Failure

**Description**:
The Messages page displays "Access Denied - You must be logged in to view messages" even when the user IS logged in as a contractor.

**Impact**:
- Contractors cannot access messages from homeowners
- Communication feature is completely broken
- Authentication state not properly detected

**Visual**:
```
Access Denied
You must be logged in to view messages.
[Go to Login]
```

**Expected Behavior**:
Should display:
- List of conversations with homeowners
- Message threads
- Ability to send/receive messages
- Empty state if no messages exist

**Reproduction Steps**:
1. Log in as contractor (confirmed logged in via dashboard)
2. Navigate to `/messages` from Quick Actions or direct URL
3. Page shows "Access Denied" error

**Possible Causes**:
- Session cookie not being read correctly on Messages page
- Authentication middleware not recognizing contractor role
- Server-side session check failing
- Client-side auth state not hydrating properly

**Recommended Fix**:
- Review authentication logic in `/messages/page.tsx`
- Check session validation middleware
- Verify JWT token is being sent with requests
- Ensure contractor role has permission to access messages

### Issue #3: Social Hub Image 404s ⚠️
**Severity**: LOW  
**URL**: `/contractor/social`  
**Status**: Missing Assets

**Description**:
The Social Hub page displays correctly but has 404 errors for post images because placeholder images don't exist.

**Console Errors**:
```
Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 (Not Found)
```

**Impact**:
- Minor visual issue
- Page structure and functionality work
- Only affects sample/placeholder posts
- Real posts with uploaded images would work fine

**Recommended Fix**:
- Add placeholder images to public folder
- Or use a placeholder image service (e.g., `placeholder.com`, `unsplash.it`)
- Or remove image elements from sample posts until real images are uploaded
