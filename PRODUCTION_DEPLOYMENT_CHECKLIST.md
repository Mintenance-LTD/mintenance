## 🚨 Rollback Plan

If critical issues found in production:

### Immediate Actions
1. **Disable payments:**

   return NextResponse.json(
     { error: 'Payment system under maintenance' },
     { status: 503 }
   );
   ```

2. **Revert deployment:**
   ```bash
   # Vercel
   vercel rollback

   # EAS
   # Promote previous build
   ```

3. **Notify users:**
   - In-app notification
   - Email to active users
   - Status page update
