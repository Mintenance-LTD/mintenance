## ‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL AREAS REQUIRING IMMEDIATE ATTENTION**

### **1. TEST COVERAGE - CRITICAL PRIORITY** ‚ùå
- **Current**: 19% test coverage (10 files vs 52 source files)
- **Target**: 70%+ coverage required for production confidence
- **Impact**: High risk of production bugs and regressions

**Required Actions:**
```typescript
// Missing essential test coverage
‚úó Authentication flow tests
‚úó Payment processing validation  
‚úó Component unit tests
‚úó Integration test suites
‚úó Error scenario handling
‚úó Real-time feature testing
```

### **2. FEATURE SCOPE MANAGEMENT - HIGH PRIORITY** ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **Issue**: Advanced features (AI analysis, social networking) may delay MVP
- **Risk**: Scope creep affecting time-to-market
- **Impact**: Increased development complexity and testing burden

**MVP Recommendation:**
```typescript
// Core MVP Features (Launch First)
‚úì User registration and authentication
‚úì Job posting and browsing
‚úì Basic bidding system
‚úì Simple payment processing
‚úì Basic messaging

// Advanced Features (Post-MVP)
‚è∏ AI job analysis
‚è∏ Contractor social network
‚è∏ Advanced analytics
‚è∏ Complex workflow automation
```

### **3. PRODUCTION CONFIGURATION - MEDIUM PRIORITY** ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **Issue**: Placeholder configurations in app.config.js and eas.json
- **Risk**: Deployment blockers and app store submission issues
- **Impact**: Cannot deploy to production stores without real credentials
