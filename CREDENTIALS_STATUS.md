## 🎯 What We Can Do Now

### ✅ Supabase Verification (READY)

With the Supabase service role key, we can now:

1. **Verify Database Schema**
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema = 'public';
   SELECT * FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name = 'escrow_transactions';
   SELECT * FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name = 'users' AND column_name = 'stripe_customer_id';
   ```

2. **Check Existing Data**
   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM escrow_transactions;
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users WHERE stripe_customer_id IS NOT NULL;
   ```

3. **Verify RLS Policies**
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM pg_policies WHERE tablename = 'escrow_transactions';
   ```

### ⚠️ Stripe Testing (BLOCKED)

**Status:** Cannot proceed without Stripe secret key

**Needed For:**
- Payment intent creation tests
- Customer creation tests
- Payment method attachment tests
- Refund tests

**Where to Get It:**
1. Go to: https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/apikeys
2. Find "Secret key" (starts with `sk_test_`)
3. Click "Reveal test key"
4. Copy and add to `.env`:
   ```bash
   STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_<your-actual-key>
   ```
