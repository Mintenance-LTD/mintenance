/**
 * MIGRATION NOTES:
 *
 * 1. This refactored file reduces the original 3,778 lines to <100 lines
 * 2. Domain-specific types are now in focused files (<400 lines each)
 * 3. Each domain follows single responsibility principle
 * 4. Types are composable and reusable across services
 * 5. Maintains backward compatibility during migration
 *
 * NEXT STEPS:
 * 1. Create remaining domain type files (auth, contractors, payments, messaging)
 * 2. Update all imports throughout codebase to use new structure
 * 3. Replace original database.ts with this refactored version
 * 4. Add automated file size checking to prevent future violations
