# Contractors Page Bug Fix

**Date:** October 11, 2025  
**Issue:** Contractors page and About page showing error boundary  
**Status:** ‚úÖ **FIX APPLIED** (requires dev server restart)

---

## üêõ BUG DESCRIPTION

### Affected Pages:
- `/contractors` - **BROKEN**
- `/about` - **BROKEN** 
- Potentially other pages using `Logo` component in Server Components

### Error Message:
```
TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'call')
    at Lazy (<anonymous>)
    at Logo [Server] (<anonymous>)
    at LinkComponent
```

### Stack Trace Analysis:
The error occurs when the `Logo` component is used within a Server Component. The `Logo` component uses Next.js `Image` component, which requires client-side hydration.

---

## üîç ROOT CAUSE

The `Logo` component (`apps/web/app/components/Logo.tsx`) was missing the `'use client';` directive.

**Why this matters:**
- Next.js 13+ uses React Server Components by default
- The `Image` component from `next/image` requires client-side JavaScript for lazy loading, intersection observer, etc.
- Server Components cannot use hooks or client-side features
- Components using `next/image` must be Client Components

---

## ‚úÖ FIX APPLIED

### File: `apps/web/app/components/Logo.tsx`

**Before:**
```tsx
import Image from 'next/image';

export default function Logo({ className = "w-8 h-8" }: { className?: string }) {
  return (
    <Image 
      src="/assets/icon.png" 
      alt="Mintenance Logo" 
      width={32} 
      height={32} 
      className={className}
    />
  );
}
```

**After:**
```tsx
'use client';  // ‚Üê ADDED THIS

import Image from 'next/image';

export default function Logo({ className = "w-8 h-8" }: { className?: string }) {
  return (
    <Image 
      src="/assets/icon.png" 
      alt="Mintenance Logo" 
      width={32} 
      height={32} 
      className={className}
    />
  );
}
```

## üöÄ TO APPLY THE FIX

### Option 1: Restart Dev Server (Recommended)
```powershell
# Stop the current server (Ctrl+C)
# Then restart:
cd apps\web
npm run dev
```

### Option 2: Force Rebuild
```powershell
# In apps/web directory:
rm -rf .next
npm run dev
```

### Option 3: Hard Refresh Browser
1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Right-click refresh button
3. Select "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"

---

## ‚úÖ VERIFICATION

After applying the fix and restarting the server:

1. **Navigate to `/contractors`**
   - Should show: "Contractor Directory" page
   - Content: "The full contractor discovery experience lives in the mobile app today..."

2. **Navigate to `/about`**
   - Should show: Full About Us page
   - Should display company information

3. **Check all pages using Logo component:**
   - Homepage ‚úÖ (was already working - uses different Image approach)
   - Login page ‚úÖ
   - Register page ‚úÖ
   - Dashboard ‚úÖ
   - Contractors page ‚è≥ (will work after fix applied)
   - About page ‚è≥ (will work after fix applied)

## üìù LESSONS LEARNED

### Best Practices for Next.js 13+ Components:

1. **Use `'use client'` when you need:**
   - React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, etc.)
   - Browser APIs (`window`, `document`, etc.)
   - Event listeners (`onClick`, `onChange`, etc.)
   - `next/image` component
   - Third-party libraries that use client-side features

2. **Keep Server Components when:**
   - Fetching data directly
   - Accessing backend resources
   - Keeping sensitive logic server-side
   - Reducing JavaScript bundle size

3. **Component Organization:**
   - Create small, focused components
   - Clearly mark client components with `'use client'`
   - Keep Server Components as the default
   - Pass data from Server to Client Components via props

## üéØ IMPACT ASSESSMENT

### Before Fix:
- ‚ùå Contractors page completely broken
- ‚ùå About page completely broken
- ‚ùå Potentially 2-3 other pages affected
- üî¥ Critical user journey blocked (homeowners can't browse contractors)

### After Fix:
- ‚úÖ All pages should render correctly
- ‚úÖ Logo displays consistently across all pages
- ‚úÖ No runtime errors
- ‚úÖ Performance not affected (Client Components are optimized by Next.js)

## üîÑ RELATED CHANGES

This fix is part of the recent logo update where we:
1. ‚úÖ Copied mobile app asset (`icon.png`) to web app
2. ‚úÖ Updated Logo component to use `next/image`
3. ‚úÖ Added `'use client'` directive (THIS FIX)

---

## üìä TESTING CHECKLIST

After server restart, verify:

- [ ] `/` (Homepage) - Logo displays
- [ ] `/login` - Logo displays  
- [ ] `/register` - Logo displays
- [ ] `/contractors` - Page loads, Logo displays
- [ ] `/about` - Page loads, Logo displays
- [ ] `/contact` - Logo displays
- [ ] `/privacy` - Logo displays
- [ ] `/terms` - Logo displays
- [ ] `/dashboard` - Logo displays (with auth)

---

## üí° RECOMMENDATION

**RESTART THE DEV SERVER NOW** to apply this critical fix.

The fix is already in the code, but Next.js may be using cached versions. A simple server restart will resolve this immediately.
