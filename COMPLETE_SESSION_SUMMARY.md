## 2️⃣ Geolocation & Contractor Verification ✅

### What Was Built:

#### Service Area API with Geocoding
**File**: `apps/web/app/api/contractor/add-service-area/route.ts` (177 lines)
- ✅ Google Maps Geocoding API integration
- ✅ Converts "London, UK" → lat/lng (51.5074, -0.1278)
- ✅ Fallback coordinates for 12 UK cities
- ✅ Stores in `service_areas` table with geolocation

#### Contractor Verification System
**Files Created**:
- `apps/web/app/contractor/verification/page.tsx` (495 lines) - Web UI
- `apps/web/app/api/contractor/verification/route.ts` (247 lines) - API
- `apps/mobile/src/screens/contractor-verification/ContractorVerificationScreen.tsx` (410 lines) - Mobile UI

**Features**:
- ✅ License number validation
- ✅ Business address geocoding
- ✅ Automatic lat/lng storage in database
- ✅ Verified badge system
- ✅ 3x visibility boost messaging

#### Homeowner Contractor Map
**Files Created**:
- `apps/web/app/contractors/components/ContractorMapView.tsx` (520 lines) - Map component
- `apps/web/app/contractors/components/ContractorsBrowseClient.tsx` (494 lines) - Browse with toggle
- `apps/web/app/find-contractors/page.tsx` (525 lines) - Standalone map page

**Features**:
- ✅ Interactive map showing contractors as pins
- ✅ Distance calculations from homeowner location
- ✅ Click contractor → view profile modal
- ✅ Sidebar list with sorting
- ✅ Toggle between List/Map view in `/contractors` page

**Mobile**: ✅ Verified existing map implementation in `apps/mobile/src`

---

## 3️⃣ Session Management Fix ✅

### Problem:
- ❌ Constant forced logouts
- ❌ No "Remember Me" feature
- ❌ No grace period for recently closed tabs

### Solution:

**File Created**: `apps/web/lib/session-manager.ts` (259 lines)

**Features**:
- ✅ **5-minute grace period** - Return within 5 min = auto login
- ✅ **Remember Me** - Stay logged in for 30 days
- ✅ **Automatic token refresh** every 60 seconds
- ✅ **Activity tracking** (mouse, keyboard, touch, scroll)
- ✅ **Tab visibility handling** - Refresh on tab reopen

**Modified**: `apps/web/lib/auth.ts` - Added remember me cookie support

### How It Works:
```
User Logs In → Timestamp Saved
User Closes Tab → Timestamp Kept
User Returns:
  < 5 min → AUTO LOGIN ✅
  > 5 min + Remember Me → AUTO LOGIN ✅
  > 5 min + No Remember Me → Password Required 🔑
```

---

## 4️⃣ Design System Standardization ✅

### Components Created (4 files, 512 lines):

1. **Icon.tsx** (180 lines) - 40+ professional SVG icons
2. **StatCard.tsx** (104 lines) - Standardized metric cards  
3. **StandardCard.tsx** (84 lines) - Consistent content cards
4. **PageLayout.tsx** (144 lines) - Two-column layout system

### Icons Replaced:

| Emoji | Icon Component | Where |
|-------|----------------|-------|
| ⭐ | `<Icon name="star" />` | Ratings everywhere |
| 📍 | `<Icon name="mapPin" />` | Locations |
| 🗺️ | `<Icon name="map" />` | Map views |
| ✅ | `<Icon name="checkCircle" />` | Success states |
| ❌ | `<Icon name="xCircle" />` | Error states |
| 💼 | `<Icon name="briefcase" />` | Jobs/Work |
| 💰 | `<Icon name="currencyDollar" />` | Money/Budget |
| 📋 | `<Icon name="alert" />` | List/Clipboard |
| 📤 | `<Icon name="upload" />` | Upload/Send |
| 🔍 | `<Icon name="discover" />` | Search |
| ☷ | `<Icon name="dashboard" />` | List view |

### Pages Updated (8):
1. ✅ ContractorMapView.tsx
2. ✅ ContractorsBrowseClient.tsx
3. ✅ Contractor Bid page
4. ✅ Messages page
5. ✅ Service Areas
6. ✅ Jobs page (already clean)
7. ✅ Dashboard (reference)
8. ✅ Profile (reference)

---

## 5️⃣ Map View Integration ✅

### Implementation:

**Original Issue**: Created map at `/contractors/map` which didn't make sense (why would contractors find contractors?)

**Fix**: 
- Created `/find-contractors` as standalone map page
- Integrated map INTO `/contractors` page with toggle button
- **Contractors** are redirected away from `/contractors` to `/jobs`
- **Homeowners** can toggle between List View and Map View

### Toggle Features:
- ☷ **List View** - Grid of contractor cards
- 🗺️ **Map View** - Geographic visualization with pins
- Seamless switching between views
- Same filters apply to both views
