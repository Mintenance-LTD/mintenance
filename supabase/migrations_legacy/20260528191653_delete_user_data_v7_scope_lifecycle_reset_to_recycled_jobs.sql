COMMENT ON FUNCTION public.delete_user_data IS
  'GDPR right-to-erasure. Role-aware. v7 (audit-76 self-review): contractor branch resets jobs.assigned_at + jobs.started_at ONLY when the job is being recycled from assigned/in_progress back to ''posted''. Completed jobs keep their historical timestamps — they''re job-facts, not personal data; the personal-data pointer (contractor_id) is nulled regardless. auth.users removal is the caller''s responsibility.';;
