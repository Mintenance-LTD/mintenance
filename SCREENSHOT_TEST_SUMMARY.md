## ⚠️ Known Issues

### Issue 1: Hydration Errors
**Pages Affected**: 
- `/contractor/profile`
- `/discover` (intermittent)

**Error Type**: `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'call')`

**Root Cause**: 
- Likely related to SSR/CSR mismatch in component rendering
- Error boundary catching the issue but preventing page display

**Impact**: 
- **Medium**: Pages worked in previous tests, core functionality is intact
- Error appears to be presentation-layer only
- Content and data fetching working correctly

**Recommended Fix**:
1. Server restart may resolve the issue
2. Check for any circular dependencies in component imports
3. Verify all client components are properly marked with `'use client'`
4. Review dynamic imports and SSR configuration
