# Add each tester to our system as we add them to Google Play:
npm run beta add-tester 1 "John Smith" john@company.com homeowner "Android internal tester"
npm run beta add-tester 1 "Sarah Johnson" sarah@company.com contractor "Android Samsung Galaxy"
```

### **Tester Invitation Process**

2. **We send personalized follow-up** with testing scenarios
