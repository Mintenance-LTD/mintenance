## 🔧 **Critical Issues Fixed**

### 1. ✅ **Contractor Profile Hydration Error**
- **Issue:** `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'call')` on `/contractor/profile`

### 2. ✅ **Discover Page TypeScript Error**
- **Issue:** Type mismatch between `Pick<User, "id" | "role" | "email">` and full `User` type

- **Solution:** Updated `DiscoverClient` interface to accept correct user type
- **Status:** **FIXED** - Page loads with proper role-based content

### 3. ✅ **Missing Textarea Component**
- **Issue:** `Module not found: Can't resolve './Textarea'` on `/contractor/card-editor`
